            <h2>Design Challenge</h2>
            <p>Please select one of the options below for your challenge.</p>

            <p>We would like you to improve the design of your chosen option. Please create your design in software of your<br> choice, such as Figma or Canva. We’d like to see your new design as a PDF.</p>

            <p>Then, please can you take your design and build it in HTML and CSS. We’re not looking for any interactivity, <br> just your static design created in HTML and CSS. We’re looking for clean, semantic HTML and easily <br> maintainable CSS. Vanilla CSS is preferred. Please can you submit this as a zip file.</p>
                
            <p>Please can you accompany your submission with an explanation of your design and details around why you <br>chose to create it the way that you did. This could be annotations on the drawing, or a supporting document. </p>

            <p>Our news feed: Please let us know if you would like to choose this option and we can give you <br>access to our demo site so you can see the current design</p>

            <p>Please can you include answers to the following questions with your design submission. <br>
            We're looking for you to show your knowledge and your writing style. We want someone <br>
            who is a strong writer, so please ensure your answers are clear and concise, and don't worry <br>
            about hitting a load of buzzwords. Please do not use any generative AIs to create your <br>
            answers, we’re looking to get to know you, not an LLM!</p>

            <p>Can you give an example of something you feel has a good user experience and briefly <br>explain why?</p>

            <p>Please can explain a couple of design or UX principles you try to follow when creating a <br> design?</p>

            <p>What do you think is the most overused semantic HTML element and why?</p>

            <p>Using an example of bad design, please can you explain a couple of ways you would <br> improve it.</p>
